  <Step title="Join the DS Cloud Discord server">
    Access our [DS Cloud Discord server](https://discord.gg/7cMBjMfWCm) and ensure your account is linked.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Prepare and upload your files">
    Make sure your project folder is zipped. Go to the channel `#commands` and use the command `/up`. The bot will ask you to upload your zip file. Drag and drop it into the response field.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy your project">
    After uploading the file, the bot will deploy your project. You‚Äôll get a confirmation message with your application details.
