Once you've signed up, you can start deploying your applications on DS Cloud after selecting the plan that suits your needs.

## Facilitating your journey with web interface 😉
If you prefer to use our Discord-based hosting system, follow these steps to deploy your application:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Join the DS Cloud Discord server">
    Access our [DS Cloud Discord server](https://discord.gg/dscloud) and ensure your account is linked.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prepare and upload your files">
    Make sure your project folder is zipped. Go to the `#commands` channel and use the command `/up`. The bot will ask you to upload your zip file. Drag and drop it into the response field.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy your project">
    After uploading the file, the bot will deploy your project. You’ll get a confirmation message with your application details.
  </Step>
</Steps>
