## API Usage Limits

To ensure fair usage and system stability, the Ds Cloud API enforces rate limits. Violations, such as abusive usage, may result in account suspension.

### Key Points

* **Abuse Policy**: Illegal or abusive use of the API can lead to account suspension.

* **Rate Limits**: If you exceed the limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Wait **30 minutes** before retrying.

* **External Applications**: Apps hosted **outside of Ds Cloud** are limited to **300 requests per minute**.
