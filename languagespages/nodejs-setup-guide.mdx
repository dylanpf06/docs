## 🚀 Introduction

- Ensure Node.js and npm are installed on your system. If not, download them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- Create an account on DS Cloud via the [login page](https://dscloud.app/login) using your email, Discord, or both.
- Make sure you have an active paid plan. View and purchase plans [here](https://dscloud.app/plans).

## ⚙️ Creating the dscloud config file

<Card
title="Learn about: how to make the configuration file for DS Cloud."
icon="link"
href="https://docs.dscloud.app/getting-started/config-file"
>
  The `dscloud.app` file configures your application, defining its name, description, version, main file, and more.
</Card>

## ▶️ Start Application

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Javascript">
    - If the `START` field is not defined in the configuration file, DS Cloud runs `node` with optimization options and specific parameters. If the `START` field is defined, its value will be executed directly. Learn more about configuration file parameters [here](https://docs.dscloud.app/getting-started/config-file#configuration-parameters).
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Typescript">
    - If the `START` field is not defined, DS Cloud runs `npx tsx MAIN` to compile and execute the main TypeScript file specified in the `MAIN` field. If the `START` field is defined, its value will be executed directly. Learn more about configuration file parameters [here](https://docs.dscloud.app/getting-started/config-file#configuration-parameters).
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

- If `node_modules` does not exist, DS Cloud runs `npm install --no-package-lock --no-audit --no-fund` to install dependencies and clean the `.npm` folder.

## 🖥️ Preparing Your Node.js Project

### 📁 Essential Configuration Files

To deploy your Node.js project on DS Cloud, include your configuration file (`dscloud.app/.config`) and essential application files in a zip file.

<Warning>
  The configuration file (`dscloud.app/.config`) must be in the root of the zip file; otherwise, DS Cloud won't find it during deployment.
</Warning>

#### 🗑️ Files to Exclude Before Uploading

- `node_modules`: DS Cloud will create this folder during installation in the production environment.
- `package-lock.json`: Dependencies will be installed based on `package.json` in the production environment.

### 🤔 Why Exclude These Files?

1. **Installation Consistency:** Excluding `node_modules` ensures dependencies are installed by the production environment, preventing local discrepancies.
2. **Updated Installations:** Dependencies are installed with the latest compatible versions listed in `package.json`.
3. **Reduced Upload Size:** Smaller upload files improve efficiency and deployment speed.

### 📄 Required Files

Three files are essential for hosting your Node project:

- [dscloud.app/.config](/getting-started/config-file)
- Main file (`mainFile.js` or `mainFile.ts`)
- [package.json](./how-to-create-your-package-json.mdx) (dependency file)

<Note>
  DS Cloud supports `TypeScript` natively, running projects through `ts-node`, but compiling to `JavaScript` is recommended for production.
</Note>

## 💡 Troubleshooting

    Ensure the "main" file specified in the configuration exists, is correctly named, and has the correct path. For files in subfolders, use `folder/file.js`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Bad Memory" icon="memory" iconType="solid">
    Minimum RAM requirements:
    - Bots: 256MB
    - Websites/APIs: 512MB
    Depending on application size and complexity, allocate more RAM to avoid the [LACK_OF_RAM](https://docs.dscloud.app/faqs/troubleshooting/LACK_OF_RAM) error.
