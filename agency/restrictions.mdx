## Minimum Resource Requirements

To ensure optimal performance and stability, all projects hosted on **DSCloud** must meet certain minimum resource requirements:

* **Bots:** Requires at least **256MB** of RAM to run efficiently.

* **Websites:** A minimum of **512MB** of RAM is needed for smooth operation.

Our platform offers plans with up to **1TB of RAM**, but the **maximum allocation per individual application is 32GB**.
<ins>If you need more than 32GB, please contact our support team.</ins>

## Storage Limitations

To maintain fair usage across all users, storage is allocated as follows:

* **All projects:** Each project comes with a default allocation of **10GB** of storage.

## Service Limits

To ensure system stability and prevent resource abuse, **DSCloud** applies specific service limitations:

### LACK\_OF\_RAM

If an application exceeds its allocated RAM limit, as defined in its [dscloud.app config file](../getting-started/config-file), it will be flagged for **LACK\_OF\_RAM** and automatically shut down to prevent system overload.

### LACK\_OF\_CPU

If an application consumes excessive CPU beyond its assigned limit, it will be flagged for **LACK\_OF\_CPU** and terminated to maintain a fair distribution of resources.
Additionally, **DSCloud strictly prohibits the hosting of applications related to cryptocurrency mining**.

At **DSCloud**, we are committed to maintaining a balanced and secure cloud environment, ensuring fair access to resources for all users.
