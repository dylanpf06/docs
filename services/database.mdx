## How to Host My Database on DS Cloud?
<Steps>
  <Step 
  title="Initial Setup" icon="database">
    The first step to host your database on **DS Cloud** is to create an instance via our [create endpoint](/database-reference/endpoint/create). This endpoint allows you to set up and configure your database.
  </Step>
  <Step

    After creating your database instance, you'll be provided with a connection string to access your database securely from anywhere.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Benchmarks

We've conducted extensive benchmarks to ensure that **DS Cloud** offers one of the fastest and most reliable database solutions. Here are some of the key findings from our tests:

- **Latency**: The average latency for database queries is ~10ms.
- **Throughput**: The average throughput for database transactions is ~5,000 transactions per second (TPS).
- **Availability**: The average availability is 99.999999999% (11 9's). (powered by a Multi-AZ Design)

In DS Cloud tests, using our infrastructure, in [Tampa, Florida](/platform/overview#our-secure-infrastructure).<br/>
Latency is lower than 10ms, and throughput is higher than ~10,000 TPS.

In an external test, we tested the latency of our database service in 10 different locations.

| Location [16a4d450kafe] | Latency (ms) |
|-------------------------|--------------|
| USA, Chicago             | 375          |
| Netherlands, Amsterdam   | 76           |
| Germany, Frankfurt       | 71           |
| France, Paris            | 18           |
| USA, Atlanta             | 348          |
| UK, Coventry             | 181          |
| Poland, Poznan           | 260          |
| Brazil, Sao Paulo        | 484          |
| Croatia, Sisak           | 139          |
| Spain, Barcelona         | 332          |

Latency increases with higher database sizes, but the latency is still lower than 50ms in most locations. Thanks to our global infrastructure powered by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

<Info>Benchmarks are not guaranteed. Latency and throughput may vary depending on your location, database size, and network conditions.</Info>
<Warning>The **latency in Africa and some locations in Asia is higher**. We are working to improve the latency in these regions.</Warning>
