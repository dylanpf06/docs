## How to Host My Database on DS Cloud?

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Setup" icon="database">
    The first step to host your database on **DS Cloud** is to create an instance via our [create endpoint](/database-reference/endpoint/db/create). This endpoint allows you to set up and configure your database.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access URL" icon="globe">
    After creating your database instance, you'll be provided with a connection string to access your database securely from anywhere.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Benchmarks

We've conducted extensive benchmarks to ensure that **DS Cloud** offers one of the fastest and most reliable database solutions. Here are some of the key findings from our tests:

* **Latency**: The average latency for database queries is \~10ms.

* **Throughput**: The average throughput for database transactions is \~5,000 transactions per second (TPS).

* **Availability**: The average availability is 99.999999999% (11 9's). (powered by a Multi-AZ Design)

In DS Cloud tests, using our infrastructure, in [Frankfurt, Germany](/platform/overview#our-secure-infrastructure).<br />
Latency is lower than 10ms, and throughput is higher than \~10,000 TPS.

In an external test, we tested the latency of our database service in 10 different locations.

| Location \[16a4d450kafe] | Latency (ms) |
| ------------------------ | ------------ |
| USA, Chicago             | 93           |
| Netherlands, Amsterdam   | 4            |
| Germany, Frankfurt       | 5            |
| France, Paris            | 13           |
| USA, Atlanta             | 103          |
| UK, Coventry             | 29           |
| Poland, Poznan           | 7            |
| Brazil, Sao Paulo        | 193          |
| Croatia, Sisak           | 33           |
| Spain, Barcelona         | 21           |

Latency increases with higher database sizes, but the latency is still lower than 50ms in most locations. Thanks to our global infrastructure powered by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).
