## Benchmarks

We've conducted extensive benchmarks to ensure that **Square Cloud** offers one of the fastest and most reliable database solutions. Here are some of the key findings from our tests:

- **Latency**: The average latency for database queries is ~10ms.
- **Throughput**: The average throughput for database transactions is ~5,000 transactions per second (TPS).
- **Availability**: The average availability is 99.999999999% (11 9's). (powered by a Multi-AZ Design)

In Square Cloud tests, using our infrastructure, in [Tampa, Florida](/platform/overview#our-secure-infrastructure).<br/>
Latency is lower than 10ms, and throughput is higher than ~10,000 TPS.

In an external test, we tested the latency of our database service in 10 different locations.

| Location [16a4d450kafe] | Latency (ms) |
|-------------------------|--------------|
| USA, Chicago             | 10           |
| Netherlands, Amsterdam   | 12           |
| Germany, Frankfurt       | 13           |
| France, Paris            | 14           |
| USA, Atlanta             | 15           |
| UK, Coventry             | 20           |
| Poland, Poznan           | 22           |
| Brazil, Sao Paulo        | 18           |
| Croatia, Sisak           | 23           |
| Spain, Barcelona         | 25           |

Latency increases with higher database sizes, but the latency is still lower than 50ms in most locations. Thanks to our global infrastructure powered by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

<Info>Benchmarks are not guaranteed. Latency and throughput may vary depending on your location, database size, and network conditions.</Info>
<Warning>The **latency in Africa and some locations in Asia is higher**. We are working to improve the latency in these regions.</Warning>
