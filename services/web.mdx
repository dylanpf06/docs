## How to Host Your Website on DS Cloud

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configuration File" icon="file">
    The first step to hosting your website on **DS Cloud** is to create a configuration file. This file serves as a blueprint for your application, defining settings that DS Cloud uses for deployment. You can follow detailed instructions for creating this file [here](/getstarted/configfile).

    Make sure the configuration file includes:

    * **SUBDOMAIN**: Your websiteâ€™s subdomain.<br />
      Example: `SUBDOMAIN: test` (test.dscloudweb.pt)

    * **MEMORY**: Set the required RAM (minimum of 512MB).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a ZIP File" icon="file-zip">
    After preparing the configuration file, zip your website files along with the **DS Cloud** configuration file. Make sure to exclude unnecessary files such as `node_modules`, `package-lock.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `__pycache__`, and others that can be generated automatically. For a list of files you don't need to upload, refer to our [guide](/faqs/automatic-deletion-files-when-deploying-an-application-to-dscloud).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Include Dependency Files" icon="box">
    Ensure that you include the dependency file in the .zip (e.g., `package.json` for Node.js or `requirements.txt` for Python). These files tell DS Cloud which dependencies to install to run your application properly.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload Your Website" icon="arrow-up">
    Once your website files are ready and zipped, go to the **DS Cloud Discord** server and use the command `/up` in the `#commands` channel to start the upload process.

    After entering the command, the bot will prompt you to upload your .zip file. Drag and drop the file into the response field to deploy your website on DS Cloud.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Common Deployment Errors" icon="x">
    <Warning>If you encounter errors during the upload process, consult our troubleshooting guide. If the issue persists, our support team is always available to help resolve any issues. Our goal is to ensure your deployment is smooth and successful.</Warning>

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="INVALID_DEPENDENCY" icon="box">
        This error occurs if the dependency file is missing. If using Node.js, create the `package.json` file, and for Python, ensure the `requirements.txt` is present.
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="INSUFFICIENT_MEMORY" icon="memory">
        This error appears if the memory setting in your configuration file is too low or not specified. Ensure the minimum required memory (512MB) is set.
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="INVALID_MAIN_FILE" icon="file-code">
        This happens when the "main" file defined in your configuration does not exist. Double-check the file name and path.
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="MISSING_CONFIG" icon="file-signature">
        Ensure that the configuration file is correctly included in the root of your .zip file and is in the correct format.

      <Accordion title="INVALID_DISPLAY_NAME" icon="file">
        The **DISPLAY\_NAME** field must be 32 characters or less. If this field is incorrect or missing, it will cause an error during deployment.
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="INVALID_START_COMMAND" icon="terminal">
        The **START** field should specify how to launch your website. If this is missing or incorrect, DS Cloud will not know how to start your application.

      <Accordion title="UPLOAD_FAILED" icon="x">
