## How to Host My Bot on DSCloud?

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configuration File" icon="file">
    The first step to host your bot on **DSCloud** is to create a detailed configuration file. This file is not just a simple text document but a comprehensive guide that defines the settings for the application on **DSCloud**. It functions as an architectural plan for your project on the platform.

    Once the plan is acquired, you need to create this file, detailing each configuration and filling it out correctly. Details on how to create this file are available [here](/getstarted/configfile), with a step-by-step guide.
  </Step>

  <Step title="ZIP File Creation" icon="file-zip">
    With the configuration file ready, the next step is to prepare your application for upload. This involves placing the application files and the **DSCloud** configuration file inside a .zip file.

    However, not all files need to be included in this .zip. Files such as `node_modules`, `package-lock.json`, `pyproject.toml`, and `poetry.lock` are not necessary, as they can be generated automatically on the server side. A list of files that do not need to be uploaded is available [here](/services/bot), helping ensure that only necessary files are in the .zip, making the upload process faster and smoother.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Dependencies File" icon="box">
    Another crucial aspect is to include the dependencies file in the .zip. This file informs the **DSCloud** platform which dependencies to install for your project. For a Node.js project, this file is the `package.json`, and for a Python project, it's the `requirements.txt`.

    These files list the libraries and packages required for the correct operation of the application. Keeping these files up-to-date is crucial to avoid installation errors. Additionally, it's important to note that native dependencies, such as `node-fetch` in Node.js and `random` in Python, should not be included in these files, as they are native libraries.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Bot Upload" icon="arrow-up">
    After following all the steps and configuring your project for **DSCloud**, it's time to upload your bot. Go to the **DS Cloud Discord** server and use the command `/up` in the channel `#commands`.

    The bot will ask you to upload your .zip file. Make sure your project folder is zipped, then drag and drop the .zip file into the response field to deploy your application.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Common Errors During Application Deployment" icon="x">
    <Warning>Even with careful preparation, some errors may occur during the application deployment process. Below are some common errors and how to resolve them. If you encounter an error not listed here, feel free to [contact our team](https://dscloud.pt/support). We are always ready to help troubleshoot and resolve any issues that may arise during the deployment process. Remember, the goal is to successfully host your bot on **DSCloud**, and we are here to help you achieve that.</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="INVALID_DEPENDENCY" icon="box">
    This error occurs when the dependency file is missing in your `.zip` file. For JavaScript applications, refer to our guide on creating the `package.json` file [here](/languages/javascript/configuring-package-json). For Python applications, follow the steps to create the `requirements.txt` file [here](/languages/python/how-to-create-your-requirements).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="FEW_MEMORY" icon="memory">
    This error happens when the RAM allocation in your configuration file is either incorrectly set, exceeds the available limit, or is below the minimum requirement. For bots, the minimum required RAM is **256MB**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="INVALID_MAIN" icon="file-code">
    This error occurs when the file specified as the "main" entry point in your configuration file is missing, incorrectly named, or has an invalid path. If your main file is inside a folder, ensure the path is correctly specified, e.g., `folder/file.js`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="MISSING_CONFIG" icon="file-signature">
    This error indicates that the configuration file is either missing from your `.zip`, not located in the root directory, or has an invalid format. Ensure the configuration file is in `.app` or `.config` format. Additionally, verify that there are no duplicate file extensions by enabling file extension visibility on your computer.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="MISSING_MEMORY" icon="memory">
    This error occurs when the **MEMORY** field is missing from your configuration file. This field defines the total amount of RAM allocated to your application.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="INVALID_DISPLAY_NAME" icon="file">
    This error occurs when the **DISPLAY_NAME** field is missing or exceeds the 32-character limit. Ensure your application's display name is defined and within the allowed character limit.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="FAILED_UPLOAD" icon="x">
    This error is typically caused by issues with the `.zip` file. Ensure the `.zip` file is properly created and not password-protected. If the file is password-protected, remove the password and try again. If the file is not password-protected but the error persists, the file may be corrupted. In this case, create a new `.zip` file and attempt the upload again.
