## Parameters

### API Key

- **Type:** `string`  
- **Required:** Yes  
- **Description:** A valid API key is required for authentication and must be provided as a string.

## Getting Started

Using the `DSCloudAPI` object, you can retrieve details about the user associated with the API key, as well as a list of applications linked to that user.

### Example

```javascript
(async () => {
    const user = await api.getUser();
    const application = api.getApplication("Application ID");

    console.log(user.applications); // List of applications
})();
```

## Application Management

With the `DSCloudAPI` client, you can access and manage your applications easily. Each application is represented as an instance of the `Application` class, allowing for convenient interaction without needing to repeatedly specify the application ID.

### Listing All Applications

```javascript
    const application = api.getApplications("Application ID");

    console.log(application); // List of applications
```
