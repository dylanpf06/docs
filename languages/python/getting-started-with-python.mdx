## üöÄ Introduction

- Before you begin, make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).
- Create an account on DS Cloud via the [login page](https://dscloud.pt/login.html) using your email, Discord, or both.
- Ensure you have an active paid plan. View and purchase plans [here](https://dscloud.pt/plans).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Creating the DS Cloud Config File

<Card

icon="link"
href="https://docs.dscloud.pt/getstarted/configfile"
>
  The `dscloud.pt` file configures your application, defining its name, description, version, main file, and more.
</Card>

## üìÑ Required Files

- `main.py` (main application file).
- [requirements.txt](./how-to-create-your-requirements) (dependency file).
- [dscloud.pt](/getstarted/configfile) (DS Cloud configuration file).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Application

- If the `START` field is not defined in the configuration file, DS Cloud will run `python MAIN`, where `MAIN` is the file specified in the `MAIN` field of the configuration file. If the `START` field is defined, its value will be executed directly. Learn more about configuration file parameters [here](https://docs.dscloud.pt/getstarted/configfile#configuration-parameters).
- DS Cloud uses `pip install` to install all dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt`.

## üñ•Ô∏è Preparing Your Python Project

When preparing your Python project for deployment on DS Cloud, ensure your project files are correctly configured and ready for deployment.

<Warning>
  The configuration file (`dscloud.pt/.config`) must be located in the root of the zip file; otherwise, DS Cloud won't find it during deployment.
</Warning>

### üìÅ Essential Configuration Files

- [dscloud.pt/.config](/getstarted/configfile)
- Main application file (`main.py`)
- Dependency file (`requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`)

#### üóëÔ∏è Files to Exclude Before Uploading

- `ffmpeg`: Pre-installed in the DS Cloud environment.
- `.venv`: DS Cloud provides an isolated environment.
- `poetry.lock`: Excluded for compatibility reasons.

### ü§î Why Exclude These Files?

Excluding `ffmpeg`, `.venv`, and `poetry.lock` ensures:

1. **Clean Environment:** Avoids conflicts with the cloud environment's configurations.
2. **Efficiency:** Reduces upload size, streamlining the process.
3. **Compatibility:** Relies on `requirements.txt` for dependency installation.

Before uploading, zip your project files in **.zip** format, excluding unnecessary files.

## üí° Troubleshooting

  <Accordion
title="Invalid or Corrupted Main File"

    Ensure the `MAIN` field in the configuration file correctly points to your `main.py` file. For files in subfolders, use the format `folder/file.py`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Insufficient Memory" icon="memory" iconType="solid">
    Minimum RAM requirements:
    - Bots: 256MB
    - Websites/APIs: 512MB
    Depending on your application's size and complexity, allocate more RAM to avoid the [LACK_OF_RAM](https://docs.dscloud.pt/faqs/troubleshooting/LACK_OF_RAM) error.

## üì§ Uploading Your Project to DS Cloud

After preparing your project files, upload them to DS Cloud to host your application.

<Tabs>
   <Tab title="Discord Upload">
    - Go to the DS Cloud Discord server and use the `/up` command in the `#commands` channel.
    - A new private channel will be created for you.
    - Upload your `.zip` file in the created channel to deploy your application.
